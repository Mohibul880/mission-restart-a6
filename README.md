## ⚡ Dynamic Features & Functionalities


#### 1) What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
null is an assigned value which means there is no value here. And undefined is a variable declared but no value is assigned.

2. What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?
The map() function creates a new array from an existing array. Without making any modification to the existing array. The map() function is used for data transformation, array of objects manipulation, and rendering data in UI. While map() returns a new array from the existing array without any modification, forEach() does not return an array by executing a function for each item.

3. What is the difference between == and ===?
In JavaScript, == is loosely understood as equal by two equal signs. This means that 1 == "1" => will return TRUE. And === is used to mean Strictly Equal. This means 1 === "1" => will return FALSE.

4. What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?
Using async/await, asynchronous code can be written but it looks like synchronous style. async allows a function to work asynchronously and it returns a promise. The await part stops the code execution until the promise is resolved.

5. Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).
Scope means which part of the code of a variable, function or object has access to. Scope is generally of three types. Global Scope, Functional or Local Scope and Block Scope.
